Converted by Arsene Wenger from a winger to striker, he redefined forward play, starting on the left, but proving just as deadly closer to goal. He scored over 20 Premier League goals five seasons running, claiming four Golden Boots, with some outrageous strikes. Not content with just scoring he provided 74 assists, including a record 20 in 2002/03, and he won two Player of the Season awards.",
